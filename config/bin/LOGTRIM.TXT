LOGTRIM   Trim logfiles            Ver 1.7 (c) 1995-2001 Horst Schaeffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOGTRIM keeps the size of logfiles within a given range (kilobytes).
Files are always cut at the beginning of a line. The optional string
is used to identify the beginning of a log section for proper cutting.

Syntax:    LOGTRIM logfile maxKB [minKB] ["string"] [options]
           --------------------------------------------------
Example:   LOGTRIM fd.log  200 160 "--------"

---------- Parameters:

logfile:   Name of file to trim (drive, path optional).
           First character of filespec must not be "@" (see below).
           File size not limited.

maxKB:     There will be no action if the file size is not beyond maxKB.
           If file size > maxKB, then:
minKB:     the file will be reduced to minKB, which defaults to half the
           value of maxKB. Comma separators are allowed.
           By default the file is cut at beginning of the next line.

string:    (optional, single or double quotes)
           LOGTRIM will search for the first occurrence of this string
           (from the break point determined by minKB) and cut at the
           beginning of that line.

           If the string cannot be found within the first 10%
           of the remaining file, the string option is ignored.

           Special feature: an empty string ("") will cause LOGTRIM
           to look for an empty line.

options:
    /A...  Alarm if maxKB exceeded, but don't trimm.
           The following text (colon optional), up to the end of line
           or a slash, is assumed to be a message for display.
           Default: "max size exceeded!"
           Example: LOGTRIM C:\path\that.log 200 /A:time to check it! /B
                                                 --------------------
    /B     Bell in case of alarm (or any errors).

output:    LOGTRIM confirms the filename and adds comments in these
           cases:
              >>  "trimmed" if file was trimmed
              >>  message if error occurred
              >>  message of /A if maxKB exceeded

note:      No action if logfile is opened by other task (but error msg).

In case of write or rename errors the temporary file LOG$$$$$.TMP may
remain in the current directory. Before deleting this file, make sure
that the original log file still exists.

Errorlevel: 0      no action or successful completion
            else:  error (message)


-------- Reading parameters from a control file (optional) -------------

For multiple logfile handling LOGTRIM can read the parameters from
a control file holding the command arguments for each file to trim
(line by line), e.g.:

           C:\LOG 30 20 'on'
           C:\FD\FD.LOG 200 160 "--------"
           C:\FD\FDTRANX.LOG 10,6,"ÄÄÄÄ"

A control file will be used by the following syntax:

           LOGTRIM @ control_file
           ----------------------
Drive and path for control_file are optional. A space between @-sign and
filespec is not required. Examples:

           LOGTRIM @loglist
           LOGTRIM @ C:\util\logfiles.lst

In the control file any lines starting with a semicolon (;) and empty
lines are ignored. If an asterisk (*) is found at the beginning of a
line, the rest of the file will be ignored. The size is limited to 4 KB.

In case of read errors in one of the log files, LOGTRIM proceeds with
the next line in the control file, but LOGTRIM will abort on write/make/
rename errors to avoid loss of data.


Release note: Ver 1.7: fixed bug that limited the number of open files

Thanks to Bat Lang for his contribution to the concept of LOGTRIM.
