    ISDATE    Compares Dates            Ver 2.3 (c) 2001 Horst Schaeffer
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Syntax: ISDATE date1 [not] [=|equal|before|after] date2

    Specifications for date1/date2:

    >>  date, format acc. to COUNTRY    e.g.:  12-05-01, 3/4/1998
    >>  a file (date tag)               e.g.:  FOO.TXT, C:\TEMP\TEST.TXT
    >>  a directory (date tag)          e.g.:  ARCHIVE, C:\TEMP
    >>  TODAY

        LFN's are supported (Win9x/2000); no wildcards!

    In addition to each date a difference
    (plus/minus days) can be given      e.g.:  today -14, TEST.TXT +1

    Default comparison operator is "equal".

    The result is returned by errorlevel:
        0:  TRUE
        1:  FALSE
      255:  error: file not found, syntax error or invalid date.

    Examples:

        isdate %var% after A:file.ext
        isdate \file.ext before today -%diff%
        isdate file.ext before 1.1.1994
        isdate file1.ext after file2.ext +1
        isdate TODAY +7 = %var%

    Extra feature:

        Option /D outputs a SET statement with the absoulute(!)
        difference (days), e.g.: SET DIFF=12
        To use this value, redirect the output to a temporary batch
        file, and CALL it. Note: the variable name DIFF is fixed.

    Notes:
        Time (stamp) is not checked
        Files must exist, else: error
        No LFN support for Win NT
        Words not case sensitive
        Year with 2 or 4 digits, no default year!

    For each date ISDATE computes the day count based on Jan 1, 1901,
    allowing dates up to the year 2079.
