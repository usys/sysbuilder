Change log for BFD v1.0.7

- Small fix when start from a folder with a space.
- Updated Ms-Dos files with win98se (turned out I was using win98fe). This 
  should solve problems when dumping a ghost image to a NTFS network share and 
  the ghost image already exists.

Change log for BFD v1.0.6

- Now also processes cds\*.*\bfd.cfg file. This will enable you to include 
  a bfd.cfg with your CD files.
  For an example look at the "corporate modboot 1.x" package found on this page:
  http://www.nu2.nu/corpmodboot/ file.

Change log for BFD v1.0.5

- Added bin\bfi.exe (new!) for building the floppy images.
- Changed building images it now always uses bfi.exe (not winimage anymore)
- Removed bin\ntrawrite.exe, bin\empty144.img, bin\empty288.img no longer 
  needed.
- Removed winimage entries from the bcd.sam (sample) file.
- Improved "d" (copy driver) command to check for required ndis.txt file.
- Removed 3 second delay before mkbt.exe, not needed anymore with mkbt v1.5
- Some small changes.
- Added "it" command to set the "image type"  (e.g. "it 288")

Change log for BFD v1.0.4

- Fixed xcopy problem when running on Windows XP

Change log for BFD v1.0.3

- When using "x dir1 dir2" it was asking file or directory, fixed.
- Added 4NT check.

Change log for BFD v1.0.2

- When "winimg" set in bfd.cfg file but winimage.exe file not found bfd used 
  to abort. Changed it to just ignore the setting and use a floppy disk to 
  create the image.
- Updated bin\mkbt.exe into version 1.5, check http://www.nu2.nu/mkbt/.
- When an invalid name is used BFD displays a list of valid names.
- Some small changes.

Change log for BFD v1.0.1

- Added "-n" parameter (no prompt for floppy media) so a lot of floppy images 
  can be created unattended (when you don't have winimage or else you would be 
  using that).
- Some small cosmetic changes.
- Using setlocal and endlocal.
