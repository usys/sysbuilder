     Software Requirement
     --------------------
     1. Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later
     2. MS-DOS version 5.0 or later
     3. MS-DOS CD-Extension (MSCDEX 2.21) or later



     III. The Procedures of Installation
     ===================================

     To install CD-ROM device driver, please follow the steps below:

     1. Insert the installation diskette in your system's 3.5-inch floppy
        disk drive.

     2. Change the directory to that of your floppy disk drive, and type
        the following at the DOS prompt:

              INSTALL <Enter>

     3. Follow the screen instructions to complete the installation.

     4. Reboot system to activate the driver.

     In general, you can just continually press the Enter key to install
     the default settings. A directory (default C:\CDROM) containing the
     CD-ROM drivers is created during installation. Your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     and CONFIG.SYS files are also modified to include the following lines:

     CONFIG.SYS :
              DEVICE=C:\CDROM\CDTECH.SYS /D:MSCD001 /UDMA2 /V

     AUTOEXEC.BAT :
              C:\DOS\MSCDEX.EXE /D:MSCD001 /M:10


     IV.  Changing Settings
     ======================

     To reconfigure the settings of the CD-ROM driver, use a text editor,
     such as EDIT.COM, to modify the previous two command lines in CONFIG.SYS
     and AUTOEXEC.BAT and then restart your computer to activate it.


     Changing the CONFIG.SYS file
     ------------------------------
     DEVICE=<path>\CDTECH.SYS /D:<device_name>

     The <device_name> is the name MSCDEX will use to find the device
     driver. The maximum length of <device_name> string is 8 characters.

     Example:
               DEVICE=C:\CDROM\CDTECH.SYS /D:MSCD001 


     Changing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
     ----------------------------
     MSCDEX /D:driver [/E] [/K] [/S] [/V] [/L:letter] [/M:number]

     Example:
               C:\DOS\MSCDEX /D:MSCD001 /M:10

     For more information, you can refer to the MS-DOS online help for MSCDEX
     by typing HELP MSCDEX.
