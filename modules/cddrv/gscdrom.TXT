 1. Installation under the DOS & Win 3.xx

 1)  Turn off your PC and connect the CD-ROM DRIVE to the PC.

     1.1 Adding the CD-ROM drive to a configuration with one IDE Hard Disk
         Set LG CD-ROM drive to SL(Slave mode) by setting a jumper
         on the middle side. The Hard Disk is set to IDE Master mode.

     1.2 CD-ROM only connection to IDE card or Secondary IDE Port on 
	 the PC Motherboard.
         Set the CD-ROM drive to MA (Master mode).
       	 (refer to the Owner's manual)

 2)  Turn the PC on.
 3)  Insert INSTALL DISK to the 3.5-inch driver.
 4)  Type 'install' on the 3.5-INCH DRIVER.
 5)  Check the directory to install. (DEFUALT C:\CDROM)
 6)  After completion of the installation, hit Enter.
 7)  Reboot the PC.
 8)  If the device driver installs successfully but the CD-ROM DRIVE 
	can't be accessed, you check the following
     	in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT.
     	
	CONFIG.SYS FILE:

        LASTDRIVE=Z

        DEVICE=C:\CDROM\GSCDROM.SYS /D:MSCD000

        AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE:

        C:\CDROM\MSCDEX /D:MSCD000

 9)  If the CD-ROM DRIVE can't be accessed continuously in MS-DOS or PC-DOS,
     	recheck the connection of P.C and CD-ROM.
 10) If the CD-ROM DRIVE can't be accessed continuously in Win3.xx,
     	recheck the following:

    10-1)  The 32BITDISKACCESS and VIRTUALHDIRQ parameter in the
           Windows SYSTEM.INI file should be set to OFF.

    10-2)  HOW TO MODIFY SYSTEM.INI:
           Using edit.exe, users can edit the SYSTEM.INI file in
           the Windows directory :

           SYSTEM.INI FILE :

           [386ENH]
           VIRTUALHDIRQ=OFF
           32bitDiskAccess=OFF

       	   (refer to the Owner's manual  )

 =============================================================================

 2.  Installation under the  Win 95
