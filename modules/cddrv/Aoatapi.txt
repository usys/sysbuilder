     I.  Introduction
     ================
     This CD-ROM package comes with an installation utility. This utility
     installs the necessary CD-ROM software device driver needed by your 
     CD-ROM drive to interface with your PC system.

     Files
     -----
     The drive installation diskette includes the following files:

     README.TXT  -- This user information text file
     INSTALL.EXE -- CD-ROM installation program
     AOATAPI.SYS -- CD-ROM device driver



     II.  Requirements
     =================

     Hardware Requirements
     ---------------------
     1. IBM PC/AT or compatible (80386-base system or higher recommended)
     2. Minimum VGA graphic display 
     3. Minimum 2M RAM recommended
     4. one free IDE socket
     5. one CD-ROM drive

     Software Requirement
     --------------------
     1. Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later
     2. MS-DOS version 6.0 or later
     3. MS-DOS CD-Extension (MSCDEX 2.21) or later



     III. Installation Procedures
     ============================

     To install CD-ROM device driver, please follow the steps below:

     1. Insert the installation diskette in your system's 3.5-inch floppy
        disk drive.

     2. Change the directory to that of your floppy disk drive, and type
        the following at the DOS prompt:

              INSTALL <Enter>

     3. Follow the screen instructions to complete the installation.

     4. Reboot system to activate the driver.


     In general, you can just continuously press the Enter key to install
     the default settings. A directory (default C:\CDROM) containing the
     CD-ROM driver will be created during installation. Your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     and CONFIG.SYS files will also be modified to include the following 
     lines:

     CONFIG.SYS :
              [common]
              DEVICE=C:\CDROM\AOATAPI.SYS /D:IDECD000
              

     AUTOEXEC.BAT :
              C:\DOS\MSCDEX.EXE /D:IDECD000



     IV.  Changing Settings after Installation
     =========================================

     To reconfigure the settings of the CD-ROM driver, use a text editor,
     such as EDIT.COM, to modify the previous two command lines in CONFIG.SYS
     and AUTOEXEC.BAT and then restart your computer to activate it.


     Changing the CONFIG.SYS file, and enabling DMA function
     -------------------------------------------------------
     DEVICE=<path>\AOATAPI.SYS /D:<device_name> [/DMA or /ULT] [/P:xxx,yy]

     The <device_name> is the name MSCDEX will use to find the device
     driver. The maximum length of <device_name> string is 8 characters.

     Example:
               DEVICE=C:\CDROM\AOATAPI.SYS /D:IDECD000 /P:1F0,14
       OR      DEVICE=C:\CDROM\AOATAPI.SYS /D:IDECD000 /DMA /P:1F0,14
       OR      DEVICE=C:\CDROM\AOATAPI.SYS /D:IDECD000 /ULT /P:1F0,14

     The option "/DMA" enables BUS MASTER function if your mother board 
     supports this function.
     The option "/ULT" enables ULTRA DMA function if your mother board 
     supports this function. 
    

     ********************************************************************
     The option "/P:" specifies the I/O port address and IRQ level. 
     The number xxx in hex specifies the I/O port address (such as 1F0, 
     170, 1E8, or 168 in HEX), and yy specifies the IRQ level (such as
     14, 15, 11, or 10 in decimal). 
     ***  Please do not add /P option if you are not familiar  *** 
     ***  with I/O port address and IRQ level                  ***
     ********************************************************************


     Changing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
     ----------------------------
     MSCDEX /D:driver [/E] [/K] [/S] [/V] [/L:letter] [/M:number]

     Example:
               C:\DOS\MSCDEX /D:IDECD001 /L:G /M:10

     For more information, please refer to MS-DOS online help for MSCDEX
     by typing HELP MSCDEX.
     
     SPECIAL NOTE:

     A. How to enable Ultra DMA/33 function on CD-ROM drive In Windows 95
     operation system.

     1. Firstly, please check if your computer ( or motherboard) supports
     Ultra DMA/33 function. ( ex. Intel 430TX, 440LX chipset supports Ultra
     DMA/33).

     2. If your computer ( or motherboard) supports Ultra DMA/33 function,
     then please enable the UDMA function in BIOS setting.

     3. Please be sure to install the PCI IDE DRIVER (Win95 version) which
     supporting Ultra DMA/33 function that your computer ( or motherboard)
     supplier provided. Thus, you can enjoy the feature of Ultra DMA/33
     function in your CD-ROM drive.

     4. If your computer ( or motherboard) supplier didn't provide the PCI
     IDE DRIVER (Win95 version) which supporting Ultra DMA/33 function.
     Please ask your supplier to provide this driver.

     5. Please do not use the DMA function of Win95 internally provided in the
     computer ( or motherboard) which supporting Ultra DMA/33 function. If you
     enable the DMA function of Win95 internally provided, it will cause your
     computer system hang up because Win95 only supports the Bus Master DMA
     function not Ultra DMA/33 function.

     6. Unfortunately if your computer system hangs up, please restart your
     computer and go to BIOS setting to disable the UDMA function then start
     your computer again. Restore your default setting in Win95.
