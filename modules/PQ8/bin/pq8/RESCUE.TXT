Running PartitionMagic from Rescue Disks

The rescue disks and PartitionMagic CD contain the necessary 
files to boot your computer and run the DOS GUI version of 
PartitionMagic. You can boot from the first rescue disk or the 
PartitionMagic CD.

The rescue disks or bootable CD will be useful in the following 
situations:

-If you have hidden the hard disk partition where PartitionMagic 
is installed and need to get back into PartitionMagic to unhide 
the partition.

-If you have accidentally converted a partition to FAT32 when your 
operating system does not support FAT32 and now your computer will 
not boot.  (Use the rescue disks to convert the partition back 
to FAT.)

-If other occasions arise when you do not have access to 
the Windows version of PartitionMagic on the CD or hard disk.

        
To use the rescue disks:
------------------------

1. Boot your computer from the first rescue disk or PartitionMagic CD.

2. If running from disks, insert the second rescue disk when prompted.

   PartitionMagic runs automatically.

Although the rescue disks run a DOS version of PartitionMagic, 
it is a full GUI application and has similar functionality to 
the Windows executable.

To access online help, insert the second rescue disk, then choose
General or Index from the Help menu.

For additional information about running PartitionMagic from
the rescue disks, including how the rescue disk version of
varies from the Windows version, refer to Chapter 1 of the 
PartitionMagic user guide (provided in PDF format).
